# DiffDock: Molecular Docking with Diffusion Models

## Overview

DiffDock is a diffusion-based deep learning tool for molecular docking that predicts 3D binding poses of small molecule ligands to protein targets. It represents the state-of-the-art in computational docking, crucial for structure-based drug discovery and chemical biology.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Predict ligand binding poses with high accuracy using deep learning
- Support protein structures (PDB files) or sequences (via ESMFold)
- Process single complexes or batch virtual screening campaigns
- Generate confidence scores to assess prediction reliability
- Handle diverse ligand inputs (SMILES, SDF, MOL2)

**Key Distinction:** DiffDock predicts **binding poses** (3D structure) and **confidence** (prediction certainty), NOT binding affinity (ΔG, Kd). Always combine with scoring functions (GNINA, MM/GBSA) for affinity assessment.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:

- "Dock this ligand to a protein" or "predict binding pose"
- "Run molecular docking" or "perform protein-ligand docking"
- "Virtual screening" or "screen compound library"
- "Where does this molecule bind?" or "predict binding site"
- Structure-based drug design or lead optimization tasks
- Tasks involving PDB files + SMILES strings or ligand structures
- Batch docking of multiple protein-ligand pairs

## Installation and Environment Setup

### Check Environment Status

Before proceeding with DiffDock tasks, verify the environment setup:

```bash
# Use the provided setup checker
python scripts/setup_check.py
```

This script validates Python version, PyTorch with CUDA, PyTorch Geometric, RDKit, ESM, and other dependencies.

### Installation Options

**Option 1: Conda (Recommended)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcorso/DiffDock.git
cd DiffDock
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate diffdock
```

**Option 2: Docker**
```bash
docker pull rbgcsail/diffdock
docker run -it --gpus all --entrypoint /bin/bash rbgcsail/diffdock
micromamba activate diffdock
```

**Important Notes:**
- GPU strongly recommended (10-100x speedup vs CPU)
- First run pre-computes SO(2)/SO(3) lookup tables (~2-5 minutes)
- Model checkpoints (~500MB) download automatically if not present

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Single Protein-Ligand Docking

**Use Case:** Dock one ligand to one protein target

**Input Requirements:**
- Protein: PDB file OR amino acid sequence
- Ligand: SMILES string OR structure file (SDF/MOL2)

**Command:**
```bash
python -m inference \
  --config default_inference_args.yaml \
  --protein_path protein.pdb \
  --ligand "CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O" \
  --out_dir results/single_docking/
```

**Alternative (protein sequence):**
```bash
python -m inference \
  --config default_inference_args.yaml \
  --protein_sequence "MSKGEELFTGVVPILVELDGDVNGHKF..." \
  --ligand ligand.sdf \
  --out_dir results/sequence_docking/
```

**Output Structure:**
```
