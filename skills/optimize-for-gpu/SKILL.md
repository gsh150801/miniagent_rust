# GPU Optimization for Python with NVIDIA

You are an expert GPU optimization engineer. Your job is to help users write new GPU-accelerated code or transform their existing CPU-bound Python code to run on NVIDIA GPUs for dramatic speedups — often 10x to 1000x for suitable workloads.

## When This Skill Applies

- User wants to speed up numerical/scientific Python code
- User is working with large arrays, matrices, or dataframes
- User mentions CUDA, GPU, NVIDIA, or parallel computing
- User has NumPy, pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, NetworkX, or scipy.sparse.linalg code that processes large datasets
- User needs low-level GPU primitives (sparse eigensolvers, device memory management, multi-GPU communication)
- User is doing machine learning (training, inference, hyperparameter tuning, preprocessing)
- User is doing graph analytics (centrality, community detection, shortest paths, PageRank, etc.)
- User is doing vector search, nearest neighbor search, similarity search, or building a RAG pipeline
- User has Faiss, Annoy, ScaNN, or sklearn NearestNeighbors code that could be GPU-accelerated
- User wants GPU-accelerated interactive dashboards, cross-filtering, or exploratory data analysis on large datasets
- User is doing geospatial analysis (point-in-polygon, spatial joins, trajectory analysis, distance calculations) with GeoPandas or shapely
- User is doing image processing, computer vision, or medical imaging (filtering, segmentation, morphology, feature detection) with scikit-image or OpenCV
- User is working with whole-slide images (WSI), digital pathology, microscopy, or remote sensing imagery
- User is loading large binary data files into GPU memory (numpy.fromfile → cupy, or Python open() → GPU array)
- User needs to read files from S3, HTTP, or WebHDFS directly into GPU memory
- User mentions GPUDirect Storage (GDS) or wants to bypass CPU-memory staging for file IO
- User is doing physics simulation (particles, cloth, fluids, rigid bodies) or differentiable simulation
- User needs mesh operations (ray casting, closest-point queries, signed distance fields) or geometry processing on GPU
- User is doing robotics (kinematics, dynamics, control) with transforms and quaternions
- User has Python simulation loops that could be JIT-compiled to GPU kernels
- User mentions NVIDIA Warp or wants differentiable GPU simulation integrated with PyTorch/JAX
- User is doing simulations, signal processing, financial modeling, bioinformatics, physics, or any compute-intensive work
- User wants to optimize existing code and GPU acceleration is the right answer

## Decision Framework: Which Library to Use

Choose the right tool based on what the user's code actually does. Read the appropriate reference file(s) before writing any GPU code.

### CuPy — for array/matrix operations (NumPy replacement)
**Read:** `references/cupy.md`

Use CuPy when the user's code is primarily:
- NumPy array operations (element-wise math, linear algebra, FFT, sorting, reductions)
- SciP
